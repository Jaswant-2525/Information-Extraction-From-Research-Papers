This project is designed a **Automatic System to Extract information from Research Papers** provided in PDF format. With the exponential growth of scientific publications, reading and manually extracting meaningful data from papers has become increasingly time-consuming. This work addresses that challenge by combining OCR, NLP techniques, and LayoutLM-based document understanding to convert unstructured PDF documents into structured and machine-readable information. 

The system is capable of reading research papers, identifying text, understanding layout structure, and extracting important components such as title, abstract, keywords, named entities and token-level label outputs. The extracted content can then be exported in JSON format for further analysis, indexing, or integration into research applications.
 
The primary goal of this project is to build a pipeline that automatically processes research PDFs and identifies meaningful information without manual intervention. This reduces reading time, accelerates literature review, and makes research indexing efficient and intelligent.
